Parallelized-Graph-Algorithms
==============================

Concepts of Parallel and Distributed Programming (COP 4520) Spring 2014 Project.  

Finding the shortest path is very important in many applications. This is computed by graph algorithms which can be computationally intensive on large graphs or datasets. Computational speed is important for real-time applications such as pathing for games, traffic analysis for GPS systems, and geodetics. We explore the parallelization of A*, Dijkstra, and Bellman-Ford using OpenMP on an SMP architecture. The performance of these algorithms are compared against their serial versions to show their parallelization efficiency. These algorithms are then experimented on real datasets and generated datasets to show the shortest path.
