To compile all the proper files required for the visual
program demonstrating serial A* and Dijkstra's
algorithms (which is essentially A* with a 0 'H' heuristic),
you need to extract this zipped file to a directory, and
then through the command prompt change the directory
to the unzipped location (i.e., cd \DocumentLocation\...),
and simply type "compile.bat".  This will execute a batch
file which will compile the proper .java files via 'javac',
and will then run the GraphGUI.java program.

Once in the program, type "grid.txt" for the best
representative graph to test the serial algorithms.
